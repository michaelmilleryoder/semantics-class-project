For example. in my first work. I used the Amazon deforestation in Brazil as the environmental issue. Yours is about the illegal traffic of animals. in a similar ecosystem. Great that you also are interested in raising awareness on those problems.    \n",

This energy source is expensive in it&#39;s set up but would provide the city with a limitless and renewable source of energy over the long run. Although the fish habitats would be altered with the use of hydro energy the existance of a reservior may provide more opportunities for recreation to City A, which is already a tourist destination. Although disruptive to the natural environment perhaps, inhabitants and tourists to this area would appreciate the effort the city is making pursuing a clean, stable and reliable energy source.    \n",

It is very cheap and can be easily converted into coal or gas. Yes, it has its pros and cons both. Considering that it might not be something that might satisfy all the needs of the city but its good utilization will overcome the other powers. We also have to see that its available in abundable in western counties and relatively a low capital investment.   \n",

As long the placement is out of the way of bird paths, it should not effect birds or other animals. It has a low start up cost compared to other forms of energy. There is a a question as to the reliability.The turbines would need to be placed in spots that get a lot of wind.   \n",
